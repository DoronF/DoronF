# Doron Fingold

(pronounced *Finegold*)

I'm currently working on a series of personal projects to deepen my understanding of **Data Science** and **Statistics**, using both **Python** and **R**. My focus has been on building practical tools like a next-word prediction model and visualizing natural language data.

Before pivoting into data science, I spent over a decade in **web and mobile startups**, building B2B and consumer-facing products. My work included:

- Early 2000s: Secure document collaboration platforms and e-learning systems for continuing education credits  
  *(ASP, .NET, C#, JavaScript, SQL)*  
- 2010s: Two mobile social networks â€” one for short-form video (iPhone 3 and early Android), another in the dating space  
  *(Objective-C, Java, PHP, SQL)*  

Now, I'm bringing that product and engineering background into the world of data.
